=>If you want to skip the staging area and want to do a direct commit:
=>eg: you had a file named as GithubSteps.txt, now you created a new text file named as Advance GithubSteps.txt,
=> =Now, you did some changes in GithubSteps.txt 
=> if you check git status now than it will show staging for 2 files 
1.modified: GithubSteps.txt 
2.include : Advanced GiThubSteps.txt
if you want to commit only for modified files rather than untracked file(Advance GithubSteps.txt):
git commit -a -m "<commit statement>"

=>To remove a file :
git rm <file name>

=> to rename a file:
git mv <file name> <renamed filename>

then commit with a proper message:
git commit -m "message"

=> To excplicitly untrack a file use command(This will not delete your file just untrack it from your git)
=> if you upload a tracked file in yout .gitignore then modify the file. The git status will 
	show you the modified message for that file, so now you have to explicitly untrack that file by using:
git rm --cached <file name>
