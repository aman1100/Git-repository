ALL THE COMMANDS USED IN GIT BASH HERE 
=> To check the present working directory:
pwd
=>to present the list of content in the folder or directory:
ls
=> To change the directory :

craete a new folder/directory and put some text files in it randomly eg: helloworld.txt, database excelfile etc .
right click and click at the option open git bash here inside your working directory.
=>to check the status of file:
git status
=>to enable git in the folder:
git init
=>for staging (A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes in small commits) all the files into the git :
git add --a
=>regarding snapshot of all the files we have to commit :
git commit -m "your comments like initial commit"
=>to check all the commits you did:
git log
=>fot staging a single file rather than all the files :
git add <filename with extension>
git commit -m "your comments like added new steps into GithubSteps.txt"
=> to stop all the tracking in github you have to use this command this wil delete the repositry of git
rm -rf .git
=> to clone any project from github url
=> visit this website, link https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
=>copy the url by tapping on code dropdown :
git clone <url>
=> to change the name of the cloned project :
git clone <url> <wanted name>
=>to quit the log pannel :
type q
=>To create a new document use :
touch <filr name.extension>
=> to ignore files and folders for tracking in github
=>create a new file named as:
touch .gitignore
	inside .gitignore name the files you want to ignore like(error.log)
	for ignoring all the files with same extension:
	*.<extensionName>
	example: *.log
	=>to ignore directories or folder:
	/<dirName> inside .gitignore file
=> compare the staging area with working directory:
git diff
=> compare past commit with current staging area:
git diff --staged
=>push and pull
	Go to github.com open your account create a new repository 
	= Name the repository
	attach ssh keys to github.com website with following steps as mentioned on the website.
	Tap on your profile at the right side corner > settings > ssh and gpg keys > add new ssh key > follow all the mentioned steps
	As ssh key of your pc attached to github.com now you can push and pull your code and files.
	=> Pushing the code and files
	1> you have to add the origin(link of that repository) of your repository from  your gitbash 
	git remote add origin <url>
	2>We dont created the branch yet so we are pushing the code into the master branch.
	check the status by using: git status
	add the files by using : git add .
	=>push the files to the origin:
	git push -u origin master 
	
	=>PULL FROM THE ORIGIN MASTER:
	git pull origin master
=>Craeting a new branch and merge it with other branch or the master branch
	=to check all the branch of our repository:
	git branch
	=to create a new branch :
	git branch <branch name (eg:login-system)>
	=Now you have to enter inside your new branch eg:<login-system>
	git checkout <branch name eg:login-system>
	=Add new files into the new branch your master branch doesnot get afftected:
	git add .
	=commit the changes:
	git commit -m "Your commit comment"
	=push all the files and code to your new branch :
	git push -u origin <branch name eg:login-system>
	=If ypu edited some piece of code or files from the github web rather than locally then pull all the files:
	git pull origin <branch name>
	
	=>Now if you want to merger you another branch eg:login-system to the main branch then:
	=>You have to enter inside your main branch 
	=>To check all the branches:
	git branch
	=>Move into the master branch:
	git checkout master
	=>TO MERGE ALL THE FILES AND CODE TO THE MASTER BRANCH:
	git merge <branch name eg:login-system>
	=>after merging all the files you have to push all the files into the master branch:
	git push -u origin master.
=>To Delete any branch from your repository:
	We have two commands for this :
		1= git branch -d <branch name eg:login-system>
		2= git psuh origin --delete <branch name eg: login-system>
	Note: You have to be in master branch to perform the delete operation 
	=> Now if you check all the branches inside your repository :
	git branch
	=> you see login-system branch is not there.
Thank You!
